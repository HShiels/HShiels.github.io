        <p>Hi! My name is Haylie Shiels, and I am a student athlete at Adrian College. I am pursuing a degree in Graphic Design and a minor in Web Design with a Level 1 Certificate in Computer Science. I am a member of the cross country and track and field teams at Adrian College.</p>

        <p>My favorite hobby is photography. I love taking pictures, specifically photos of race cars. It is a lot of fun to test out different photo techniques and to see the final results. I have taken a few classes in college to learn more about photography and its different styles. My favorite thing to take pictures of are race cars or other cars. I love capturing the movement when they are racing or using light painting to capture cool shots of stationary cars.</p>
